Ever since deciding to lead a more plant-based, vegetarian lifestyle I had the different choices of what to eat for my protein instead of meat? I tried going vegetarian years ago and did not make the proper swaps and needed to go back to meat in a couple of months for protein/nutrients, so I know I wanted to do it right.

I kept seeing things about Aldi's new vegetarian frozen food line, so I decided to give it a shot. 

Aldi has a couple of new options, vegetarian patties and meat free meatballs to name a few, so I decided to pick a couple of those up.

First up to try was the black bean burger, it comes frozen in a package with four burgers and you can heat them up in microwave, skillet or bake - I opted to bake it. This one was much spicier than I expected, so bare that in mind if you want to pick that one up. 

Next up was the Quinoa Crunch burger, which was very good, I would be reaching for this one a lot, the quinoa was baked in for protein but I could not really taste it and it did not make it taste gritty.

Last up here was the meat free meat balls that I opted to try on my next pasta night. This was a miss for me as there was not enough flavor to the fake meat and it tasted pretty bland to me.
