The Aldi smoothies have been a "hit" for me ever since I started shopping there years ago. These are about 85 cents PER SMOOTHIE. I have seen a mango flavor and a strawberry flavor, so there is not a lot of variety, however, the options you do have are quality, convenient and cheap.

Before living a more remote work based lifestyle, these were a staple for me for breakfasts. I would bring them to my office and keep as breakfasts or snacks during the workday, or even drink one on the way to work.

The smoothies are well blended, and not to gritty or harsh as the flavors are pretty classic. 

Another amazing fruit juice/smoothie from Aldi is the Green Smoothie which comes in a 64 oz container and even though it looks green and contains spinich and greens, it is never too much that it tastes like spinich or bitter. Another great choice!
