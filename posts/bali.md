There has been the recent social media trend


Despite their potential age and low reproductive rate, bristlecone pines, particularly _Pinus longaeva_, are usually a [first-succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_succession 'Primary succession') species, tending to occupy new open ground.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-FEIS-2) They generally compete poorly in less-than-harsh environments, making them hard to cultivate.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-FEIS-2) In gardens, they succumb quickly to root rot.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-3) They do very well, however, where most other plants cannot even grow, such as in rocky [dolomitic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomite_(mineral)> 'Dolomite (mineral)') soils in areas with virtually no rainfall.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-FEIS-2)

Bristlecone pines grow in scattered [subalpine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subalpine 'Subalpine') groves at high altitude in arid regions of the [Western United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States 'Western United States'). Bristlecones, along with all related species in class Pinopsida, are [cone-bearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer_cone 'Conifer cone') [seed plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_plant 'Seed plant') commonly known as [conifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer 'Conifer'); the name comes from the prickles on the female cones.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-ARKive-4)
