title: 'Aldi Red Bag Chicken, Yay or nay'
---

There has been the recent social media trend of people cooking the Aldi Red Bag Chicken claiming it tastes just like Chic-fila. What, I can have the crispy chicken sandwich we know and love without any guilt about the organizations they support? win-win. I knew I needed to try this out.

On my next Aldi run, I picked this up in my haul. If you are looking for this chicken, make sure to look for it in the freezer section with all the rest of the frozen meat, not with the refridgerated raw chicken.

The chicken comes in a red bag and is precooked and preseasoned, all you need to do is "cook" it to heat it up and presto, fried chicken. 

For the full experience, I made sure to get fresh hamburger buns and frozen waffle fries so I can feel I am getting an authentic "CFA Dupe" meal. Once I got home, I popped a piece of chicken in my air fryer for 10 mins on 350 so it will get nice and crispy. I loved how the bag was resealable, making it easy to store the rest of the chicken for later.

My verdict? It is very good, maybe a little bit saltier than CFA but a great alternative if you do not want to support their values or just want to save some money and eat at home. I would recommend this.





Bristlecone pines grow in scattered [subalpine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subalpine 'Subalpine') groves at high altitude in arid regions of the [Western United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States 'Western United States'). Bristlecones, along with all related species in class Pinopsida, are [cone-bearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer_cone 'Conifer cone') [seed plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_plant 'Seed plant') commonly known as [conifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer 'Conifer'); the name comes from the prickles on the female cones.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-ARKive-4)
